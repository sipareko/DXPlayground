## Set Up the Salesforce DX Project

Our first goal is to set up a developer project which we'll use to modify our application. It starts by cloning the repository.

## Steps

Authorize to your Developer Hub (Dev Hub) org. At the moment, the DevHub is the Salesforce DX Trial Org.

    sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a "Hub Org"

If you already have an authorized Dev Hub, set it as the default:

    sfdx force:config:set defaultdevhubusername=<username|alias>

Create a scratch org.

    sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json

If you want to use an existing scratch org, set it as the default:

    sfdx force:config:set defaultusername=<username|alias>

Push your source.

    sfdx force:source:push

Open the scratch org.

    sfdx force:org:open --path one/one.app

## Resources

For details on using sfdx-simple, please review the [Salesforce DX Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev).

## Description of Files and Directories  

* **sfdx-project.json**: Required by Salesforce DX. Configures your project.  Use this file to specify the parameters that affect your Salesforce development project.
* **config/project-scratch-def.json**: Sample file that shows how to define the shape of a scratch org.  You reference this file when you create your scratch org with the force:org:create command.   
* **force-app**: Directory that contains the source for the sample Force.com app and tests.   
* **.project**:  Required by the Eclipse IDE.  Describes the Eclipse project. 
* **.gitignore**:  Optional Git file. Specifies intentionally untracked files that you want Git (or in this case GitHub) to ignore.
